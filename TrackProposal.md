# Math for Data Science

Mathematics is the bedrock of data science. Almost all the techniques of modern data science, including machine learning and deep learning, have a deep mathematical underpinning. This track will imbibe the ability to think not in term of dry numbers but abstract mathematical entities (and their properties and inter-relationships). Learn the expertise in implementing mathematical concepts relevant in data science using Python.

## 1.Basic Math 

Recall the basics - set theory, logarithms, functions, and equations using 'math' module of Python. Math module provides access to the mathematical functions inbuilt in the Python’s library.

## 2.Linear Algebra

Learn about scalar, vector, matrix & tensor and various arithmetic operations on it using NumPy. NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
 
## 3.Calculus

Learn to formulate the functions used to train algorithms.It lurks behind the simple looking analytical solution of ordinary least square problem in linear regression, or it is embedded in every back-propagation a neural network makes to learn a new pattern.

## 4.Probability

Master the concepts of basic probability, conditional probability, and various probability distribution.Probability theory is the mathematical foundation of statistical inference.

## 5.Statistics

Statistics is the 'grammar’ of data science. An introduction to the various types and concepts of statistics and how to use Python to analyze data, infer an outcome from the data and evaluate the results.

## 6.Discrete Math

All modern data science is done with the help of computational systems and discrete math is at the heart of such systems. A refresher in discrete math will imbue the learner with concepts critical to daily use of algorithms and data structures in analytics.

## 7.Math commonly used Machine Learning algorithms 

It’s time to put it all together. In this course you will learn how the various branches of math described earlier is underpinned in building real-world machine learning algorithms. 
i.   Naive Bayes
ii.  Linear Regression
iii. Logistic Regression
iv.  Decision Trees
