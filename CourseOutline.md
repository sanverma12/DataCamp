# Course Outline

## Chapter 1 - Descriptive Statistics 

Master the art of descriptive statistic which is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information. 

### Lesson 1.1-Central Tendency and Dispersion Tendency (Sample exercise is based on this lesson)

A learning objective: Learner will be able to understand the most common measures of central tendency (mean, mode and median) and the most common measures of dispersion (variance and standard deviation). Display the central tendency and dispersion tendency using the Pandas library.

### Lesson 1.2- Modality, Skewness, and Kurtosis

A learning objective: Learner will be able to acquire the understanding of modality, skewness, and kurtosis in data analysis and find it for the given dataset using the Pandas.

### Lesson 1.3-Univariate & Multivariate Analysis

A learning objective: Learner will be able to perform univariate analysis i.e. analysis of one variable and multivariate analysis which involves the analysis of two or more variables for the purpose of determining the empirical relationship between them. Matplotlib library in python will be used to plot scatterplot, stacked bar-chart, and bivariate line chart.

## Chapter 2 - Inferential Statistics

Become an expert in the inferential statistics which will allow making inferences about the population from the sample data. This domain of statistic teaches the art of prediction of the ‘unknown’ from the ‘known’.

### Lesson 2.1-Central Limit Theorem 

A learning objective: Learner will be able to derive insight into Central Limit Theorem(CLT) and how it can be useful in the field of data science. Rolling the dice example with NumPy and Matplotlib will be used to illustrate the theorem.

### Lesson 2.2-Confidence Interval

A learning objective: Learner will be able to deep dive into the concept of confidence interval and its significance.

### Lesson 2.3-Hypothesis Testing 

A learning objective: Learner will be able to understand the various types of hypothesis testing based on the type of data and how it can be helpful in analyzing/interpreting the data. Hands-on on various kind of hypothesis testing like Ztest, Chi-Square test, ANOVA test using Python modules.

### Lesson 2.4-Quantitative Data (Correlation & Regression)

A learning objective: Learner will be able to create the correlation matrix and create a regression model on the sample dataset using Pandas.

## Chapter 3 - Statistical Learning

Statistical learning is a framework for understanding data based on statistics, which can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. Learn the various aspect of statistical learning to better understand, summarize and improve the predicted result.

### Lesson 3.1-Parametric & Non-parametric methods

A learning objective: Learner will be able to discover about the parametric methods and how is it different from a non-parametric method and also illustrate their use cases.

### Lesson 3.2-Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability

A learning objective: Learner will be able to calculate the prediction accuracy of the classification model using the confusion matrix, and of a regression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Lesson 3.3-Bias-Variance Trade-off

A learning objective: Learner will be able to understand the concept of bias and variance and how the trade-off determines the efficiency of the model.

## Chapter 4- Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics is a mathematical procedure that applies probabilities to statistical problems. It provides learners the tools to update their beliefs in the evidence of new data.

### Lesson 4.1-Understanding the Bayesian Statistics

A learning objective: Learner will be able to understand how bayesian statistics is different from the frequentist statistics and why is it important to learn about it in data science.

### Lesson 4.2-Bayesian Inference

A learning objective: Learner will be able to acquire the idea behind the bayesian inference by an example of coin tossing.

### Lesson 4.3-Test for Significance

A learning objective: Learner will be able to understand Bayes factor which is equivalent to p-value in bayesian framework.

### Lesson 4.4- Let’s wrap it up!!!

A learning objective: Learner will be able to recap the entire learning in this course briefly.
