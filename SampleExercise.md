## Context

### Finding out the Central Tendency(mean,median and mode) and Dipsersion Tendency(variance and standard deviation) from Employees’s Dataframe of the company-APL.

In this exercise, you'll practice finding the mean, mode, median, variance and standard deviation of given Dataframe containing the details like Name, Age, Salary and Ratings of the company APL's employees.

A DataFrame - ‘Employees’, is available in your workspace.

Unless otherwise noted, assume that all required packages are loaded with their common aliases throughout this course.

ii.	Find the mean age of the employees.

iii.Find the median salary of the employees.

iv.	Find the mode of ratings of the employees.

v.	Find the variance in the salary of the employees.

vi.	Find the standard deviation in the salary of the employees.


## Excercise

### Print the first 5 rows for inspection
print (Employees. _ _ _ _())

### Mean age of the employees
